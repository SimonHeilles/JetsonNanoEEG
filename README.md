# JetsonNanoEEG
My own version of the "Artificial Intelligence on Thoughts" project. I will be using the Jetson Nano to decode brain waves (EEG).

I am a student in data science and psychology. I decided to work on an innovative project that requires both skills in artificial intelligence and neurosciences. This project is more than inspired by this one : https://www.hackster.io/dnhkng/aiot-artificial-intelligence-on-thoughts-f62249, which is a Jetson Nano Community project, credits going to dnhkng (https://github.com/dnhkng/AIoT).

To me, there are several reasons to work on this project : I think the idea is great and I want to try it myself ! But I also have a few concerns about how far is it possible to go with an EEG and artificial intelligence, and I want to found out (or at least, learn more) about the limits and the constraints here.
I want to do on my own too, because I am not quite sure I have the required skills for this kind of job and I am very curious about the kind of technologies he has been using and if yes or no I will be able to deal with those too and get the job done.

First step : reproducing dnhkng's project (with this EEG : https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/ and a diy headset, because the one used in the original project is obsolete)

Second step : using small areas in our brain like Broca's or Wernicke's and their properties (speech related) and see if we can detect an activation with EEG. We want to know if by talking to ourselves for example, or singing a song in our head we can trigger the EEG and the algorithm. We have to check the possibilities of detecting an activation in these areas thanks to EEG. 

Third step : doing some basic prediction work inspired by the original project or maybe by this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz9-N_mRI04
