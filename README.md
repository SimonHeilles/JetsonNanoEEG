# JetsonNanoEEG
My own version of the "Artificial Intelligence on Thoughts" project. I will be using the Jetson Nano to decode brain waves (EEG).

I am a student in data science and psychology. I decided to work on an innovative project that requires both skills in artificial intelligence and neurosciences. This project is more than inspired by this one : https://www.hackster.io/dnhkng/aiot-artificial-intelligence-on-thoughts-f6224, which is a Jetson Nano Community project, credits going to dnhkng (https://github.com/dnhkng/AIoT).

To me, there are several reasons to work on this project : I think the idea is great and I want to try it myself ! But I also have a few concerns about how far is it possible to go with an EEG and artificial intelligence, and I want to found out (or at least, learn more) about the limits and the constraints here.
I want to do on my own too, because I am not quite sure I have the required skills for this kind of job and I am very curious about the kind of technologies he has been using and if yes or no I will be able to deal with those too and get the job done.
